## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[DKRCommands Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DKRCommands/DKRCommands/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the
> available [Documentation](https://karel-kryda.gitbook.io/dkrcommands/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/DKRCommands/DKRCommands/issues)
that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question
in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/DKRCommands/DKRCommands/issues/new/choose).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment
  components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://karel-kryda.gitbook.io/dkrcommands/). If
  you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there
  is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in
  the [bug tracker](https://github.com/DKRCommands/DKRCommands/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside the GitHub community have
  discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
    - Stack trace (Traceback)
    - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
    - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
    - Possibly your input and the output
    - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue
> tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead, sensitive bugs should be emailed to the owner of this repository.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/DKRCommands/DKRCommands/issues/new/choose). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether
  it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to
  recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem
  and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for DKRCommands, **including completely new
features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the
community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://karel-kryda.gitbook.io/dkrcommands/) carefully and find out if the functionality is
  already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/DKRCommands/DKRCommands/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been
  suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to
  convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be
  useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users,
  consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DKRCommands/DKRCommands/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point
  you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part
  which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most DKRCommands users. You may also want to point out the other
  projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

#### Key Technical Skills

- Node.js (You should know what are promise, async/await and arrow function etc.)
- TypeScript
- Discord.js

#### How to start

- clone the latest version of the `development` branch using Git
- edit the code in the `src` folder
- test if the new code contains any problems with `npm run lint` and `tsc`
- test the new code properly to make sure everything works as it should
- create a new pull request in the `development` branch containing a detailed description of your changes

### Improving The Documentation

To help improve the documentation, you can open a new issue with the corresponding template. Please provide a link to
that section of the documentation, including a detailed description of the change and the proposed change.

## Styleguide

### Coding Styles

- follow ESLint
- methods and functions should be documented with JSDoc

### Name Convention

- camelCaseType

### Tools

- Node.js >= 16.9.0
- NPM >= 8.19
- Git
- IDE that supports ESLint and EditorConfig (I am using IntelliJ IDEA)

### Commit Messages

We use the following scheme for commit messages:

- each important part of a commit always has its own line
- each line starts with a corresponding emoticon:
    - ‚ûï plus - added something new
    - üñåÔ∏è brush - edited something related to visuals
    - ü™õ screwdriver - fixed something small
    - üîß wrench - fixed something big
    - üóëÔ∏è trash - deleted something
    - etc.
- the emoticon is followed by a description of the change starting with a capital letter
- variable or code component names are enclosed in these \`xyz\` brackets

#### Example:

```plain
‚ûï Added built-in methods for listing and deleting slash commands
ü™õ Fixed bug where commands required certain permissions (roles, etc.) even in DMs
```
